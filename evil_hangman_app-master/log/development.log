    4: <p>So what makes Evil Hangman so evil? In typical hangman, the word is chosen in advance and stays fixed. Evil Hangman makes is as hard as possible to win, by changing the word in every time, in order for the guessed letter to not be in the word. The computer keeps a list of every word in the English language (or, a set of words of fixed length) and selectively pares down the list in order to keep the user from guessing the "correct" word.</p>
